        <h2>Exchange of Vows</h2>
        <p>Princess Ruby, dressed in a gown woven with threads of HTML and CSS, exchanged vows with Prince Python, who looked dashing in a suit tailored from the finest lines of Python code. Their promises to each other were written in the sacred language of binary, a secret code only decipherable by those with the deepest understanding of the programming arts.</p>

    <div id="dance">
        <h2>First Dance</h2>
        <p>The couple's first dance was a waltz of conditional statements, gracefully moving through if-else loops as the orchestra played a symphony of 1s and 0s.</p>

    <div id="feast">
        <h2>Feast of Algorithms</h2>
        <p>The feast that followed was a buffet of algorithmically arranged dishes. From binary-baked cookies to hexadecimal hors d'oeuvres, every byte-sized treat delighted the coding connoisseurs in attendance.</p>
    </div>

    <div id="lights">
        <h2>Illumination with LED Lights</h2>
        <p>As the night continued, the Castle of Variables was illuminated with a dazzling display of LED lights, each one programmed to dance in harmony with the rhythm of the kingdom.</p>
